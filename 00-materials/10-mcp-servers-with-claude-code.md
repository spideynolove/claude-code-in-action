# 10 Mcp Servers With Claude Code

MCP servers with Claude Code
02:53
 

You can extend Claude Code's capabilities by adding MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. These servers run either remotely or locally on your machine and provide Claude with new tools and abilities it wouldn't normally have.

One of the most popular MCP servers is Playwright, which gives Claude the ability to control a web browser. This opens up powerful possibilities for web development workflows.

Installing the Playwright MCP Server

To add the Playwright server to Claude Code, run this command in your terminal (not inside Claude Code):

claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest

This command does two things:

Names the MCP server "playwright"
Provides the command that starts the server locally on your machine
Managing Permissions

When you first use MCP server tools, Claude will ask for permission each time. If you get tired of these permission prompts, you can pre-approve the server by editing your settings.

Open the .claude/settings.local.json file and add the server to the allow array:

{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["mcp__playwright"],
    "deny": []
  }
}

Note the double underscores in mcp__playwright. This allows Claude to use the Playwright tools without asking for permission every time.

Practical Example: Improving Component Generation

Here's a real-world example of how the Playwright MCP server can improve your development workflow. Instead of manually testing and tweaking prompts, you can have Claude:

Open a browser and navigate to your application
Generate a test component
Analyze the visual styling and code quality
Update the generation prompt based on what it observes
Test the improved prompt with a new component

For instance, you might ask Claude to:

"Navigate to localhost:3000, generate a basic component, review the styling, and update the generation prompt at @src/lib/prompts/generation.tsx to produce better components going forward."

Claude will use the browser tools to interact with your app, examine the generated output, and then modify your prompt file to encourage more original and creative designs.

Results and Benefits

In practice, this approach can lead to significantly better results. Instead of generic purple-to-blue gradients and standard Tailwind patterns, Claude might update prompts to encourage:

Warm sunset gradients (orange-to-pink-to-purple)
Ocean depth themes (teal-to-emerald-to-cyan)
Asymmetric designs and overlapping elements
Creative spacing and unconventional layouts

The key advantage is that Claude can see the actual visual output, not just the code, which allows it to make much more informed decisions about styling improvements.

Exploring Other MCP Servers

Playwright is just one example of what's possible with MCP servers. The ecosystem includes servers for:

Database interactions
API testing and monitoring
File system operations
Cloud service integrations
Development tool automation

Consider exploring MCP servers that align with your specific development needs. They can transform Claude from a code assistant into a comprehensive development partner that can interact with your entire toolchain.
