# Custom commands

Claude Code comes with built-in commands that you can access by typing a forward slash, but you can also create your own custom commands to automate repetitive tasks you run frequently.

## Creating Custom Commands
To create a custom command, you need to set up a specific folder structure in your project:

- Find the .claude folder in your project directory
- Create a new directory called commands inside it
- Create a new markdown file with your desired command name (like audit.md)

The filename becomes your command name - so audit.md creates the /audit command.

## Example: Audit Command
Here's a practical example of a custom command that audits project dependencies for vulnerabilities:

This audit command does three things:

- Runs npm audit to find vulnerable installed packages
- Runs npm audit fix to apply updates
- Runs tests to verify the updates didn't break anything
After creating your command file, you must restart Claude Code for it to recognize the new command.

## Commands with Arguments
Custom commands can accept arguments using the $ARGUMENTS placeholder. This makes them much more flexible and reusable.

For example, a write_tests.md command might contain:

```
Write comprehensive tests for: $ARGUMENTS

Testing conventions:
* Use Vitests with React Testing Library
* Place test files in a __tests__ directory in the same folder as the source file
* Name test files as [filename].test.ts(x)
* Use @/ prefix for imports

Coverage:
* Test happy paths
* Test edge cases
* Test error states
```
You can then run this command with a file path:

/write_tests the use-auth.ts file in the hooks directory 

The arguments don't have to be file paths - they can be any string you want to pass to give Claude context and direction for the task.

## Key Benefits
- Automation - Turn repetitive workflows into single commands
- Consistency - Ensure the same steps are followed every time
- Context - Provide Claude with specific instructions and conventions for your project
- Flexibility - Use arguments to make commands work with different inputs

Custom commands are particularly useful for project-specific workflows like running test suites, deploying code, or generating boilerplate following your team's conventions.

USER QUESTIONs (IDEAs)

=> What I'm interested in is whether there is a "github project" that supports generating "claude-code commands" based on the initial request, or a page that summarizes the type of commands that often appear when "vibe code" regardless of the type of project. Furthermore, is it possible to create a "hook or agent" that automatically creates commands to use? It's like a mechanism that creates code or some support features in the software making process for easy self-use.
