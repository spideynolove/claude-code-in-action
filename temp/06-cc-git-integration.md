# Github integration

Claude Code offers an official GitHub integration that lets Claude run inside GitHub Actions. This integration provides two main workflows: mention support for issues and pull requests, and automatic pull request reviews.

## Setting Up the Integration
To get started, run /install-github-app in Claude. This command walks you through the setup process:

Install the Claude Code app on GitHub
Add your API key
Automatically generate a pull request with the workflow files
The generated pull request adds two GitHub Actions to your repository. Once merged, you'll have the workflow files in your .github/workflows directory.

## Default GitHub Actions
The integration provides two main workflows:

### Mention Action
You can mention Claude in any issue or pull request using @claude. When mentioned, Claude will:

- Analyze the request and create a task plan
- Execute the task with full access to your codebase
- Respond with results directly in the issue or PR
### Pull Request Action
Whenever you create a pull request, Claude automatically:

- Reviews the proposed changes
- Analyzes the impact of modifications
- Posts a detailed report on the pull request
## Customizing the Workflows
After merging the initial pull request, you can customize the workflow files to fit your project's needs. Here's how to enhance the mention workflow:

### Adding Project Setup
Before Claude runs, you can add steps to prepare your environment:
```
- name: Project Setup
  run: |
    npm run setup
    npm run dev:daemon
```
### Custom Instructions
Provide Claude with context about your project setup:

```
custom_instructions: |
  The project is already set up with all dependencies installed.
  The server is already running at localhost:3000. Logs from it
  are being written to logs.txt. If needed, you can query the
  db with the 'sqlite3' cli. If needed, use the mcp__playwright
  set of tools to launch a browser and interact with the app.
```
### MCP Server Configuration
You can configure MCP servers to give Claude additional capabilities:

```
mcp_config: |
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "playwright": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "@playwright/mcp@latest",
          "--allowed-origins",
          "localhost:3000;cdn.tailwindcss.com;esm.sh"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```
## Tool Permissions
When running Claude in GitHub Actions, you must explicitly list all allowed tools. This is especially important when using MCP servers.
```

allowed_tools: "Bash(npm:*),Bash(sqlite3:*),mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot,mcp__playwright__browser_click,..."
```

Unlike local development, there's no shortcut for permissions in GitHub Actions. Each tool from each MCP server must be individually listed.

## Best Practices
When setting up Claude's GitHub integration:

- Start with the default workflows and customize gradually
- Use custom instructions to provide project-specific context
- Be explicit about tool permissions when using MCP servers
- Test your workflows with simple tasks before complex ones
- Consider your project's specific needs when configuring additional steps

The GitHub integration transforms Claude from a development assistant into an automated team member that can handle tasks, review code, and provide insights directly within your GitHub workflow.
